Independent Publisher
=====================

Independent Publisher is a WordPress Theme by [https://raam.org/](Raam Dev), now also available for Chyrp.

The main site for this project, along with a demo of this theme, is located at [http://independentpublisher.me](http://independentpublisher.me).

This is an early stage of porting the theme process. Many things have been translated over to Chyrp's Twig syntax, but the overall theme rendering might appear brittle at certain pages.

Having taken the approval from the author of the Independent Publisher WordPress theme, I am creating this repo, so other Chyrp users like me can enjoy this awesome work of Raam Dev.

Aside of that, Pull-Requests are encouraged to help pushing this process forward, so that Independent Publisher for Chyrp goes walking the original theme's footprints.

A live demo of this port can be seen on my personal blog [http://xhezairi.com](http://xhezairi.com)
